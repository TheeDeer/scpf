# Combative Equipment
In order to maintain a fair gameplay experience for players, there is some information that you need to be aware of surrounding the use of combative equipment. Combative equipment refers to tools that can harm or apply effects (e.g. stunning) to a player that members find themselves holding, **no matter how it was obtained**.

In some instances, depending on what team you're playing as, your department guidelines may override what is stated here. It is advised you seek further information.

- Combative equipment may not be used to threaten other personnel, regardless of their actions.
- Combative equipment may not be equipped within the proximity of any Level 4+ personnel.
- Personnel may never use combative equipment for their own amusement.
- Combative equipment may be used to terminate confirmed exploiters (such as ones clearly flying/no clipping) after valid video evidence of the exploit has been obtained and forwarded accordingly for review.
- Combative equipment may be used to terminate personnel clearly contaminated by a lethal, infectious anomaly as means of self-defence from said infection, as long as the subject of termination does not hold a clearance of Level 4 or above.
- Combative equipment may be used as means of self-defence against rogue personnel (with a clearance below Level 4) as long as, besides evidence having been collected and sent to the Ethics Committee, they…
    - Harm the person in question first; or
    - Equip their weapon, aim at the person in question, and are about to fire at them.
- Personnel may use their combative equipment for self-defence against armed Class D/E personnel if they have any combative equipment equipped themselves, are clearly about to/planning on causing harm to the person in question or others around them during a riot, and there is no Foundation combative personnel nearby to assist.

It is worth mentioning that combative (or any) personnel may not terminate, harm, neglect, or otherwise discriminate against Class D/E personnel who have purchased and own a game pass but are not using it. For instance, they may be terminated for **using** a game pass that provides combative equipment, but not for **possessing** said game pass.

# Discord Servers
Here at the Foundation, we have a couple of Discord servers that are publicly available to join. These are listed below, along with their descriptions.

There are also some invite-only Discord servers, but these are primarily dependent on the position you hold in the Foundation. For example, if you are a member of the Security Department, you will be granted access to the Security Department Discord server. Invite-only links are handed out via direct messages or are posted within a Discord channel you'll gain access to when you have the appropriate user tags.

## Main
[https://discord.gg/scproblox](https://discord.gg/scproblox)

This is the main Discord server for the Foundation. It is the first place of entry for members, so everyone is invited! Announcements, updates, and general discussions are posted/held here.

It is a requirement for all personnel to be within the main Discord server and their department Discord servers to keep up-to-date. Anyone who is not within their relevant Discord servers is at risk of being removed from their position entirely.

### Verification
In order to verify or reverify your account, please use the command "**-verify**" within a Discord channel. A message will be sent detailing instructions for this process.

### Roles
Discord roles and nicknames for members of the community are automatically set when you speak in a channel. There is a cooldown of 10 minutes before checking what tags and nickname should be set for your Discord account. This is to reduce API requests sent to the verification server.

A verified Roblox account must be linked with your Discord account in order to receive Discord roles. For information on how to do this, please see the section on [verification](#verification).

## Community Engagement Staff

This is the Community Engagement Staff's server. As this team is responsible for events and community engagement, you can expect game nights and other fun activities to be hosted here.
